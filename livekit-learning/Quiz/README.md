## Tips for Learning

- **Don't peek at answers first** - Struggling to recall information strengthens memory
- **Write out your answers** - Don't just think them, actually write them down
- **Explain out loud** - If you can teach it, you understand it
- **Review wrong answers** - These are your biggest learning opportunities
- **Take breaks** - Spaced repetition is more effective than cramming
